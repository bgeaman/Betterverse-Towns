	The permission, towny.wild.block.[item id] is now towny.wild.block.[item id].[action], where [action] is build, destroy, switch, item_use. So just add .* onto the end to function normally.

	World names are now filtered like the other objects in the universe, worlds with / are no longer just using the last token.
	Reworded errors when making new towns. "You" was hardcoded, and didn't take into account admins making towns for others. To clarify, money is taken from the new mayor's bank account.
	Added new config option save_on_load. It's defaulted to off (which is opposite to what it was before). It will no longer to a giant save on startup which assured that what's in memory = saved in file. This should speed up startup of particular large db.
	Files are deleted when the object is deleted. It will not delete existing files, so files deleted outside of towny's regular actions will remain.
	Added allow_resident_plots to enable/disable plot commands, essentially freezing the plot system.
	Fixed admin add command (you couldnt add if you werent a mayor/assistant of any town).
