	Added new config option save_on_load. It's defaulted to off (which is opposite to what it was before). It will no longer to a giant save on startup which assured that what's in memory = saved in file. This should speed up startup of particular large db.
	Files are deleted when the object is deleted. It will not delete existing files, so files deleted outside of towny's regular actions will remain.
	Added allow_resident_plots to enable/disable plot commands, essentially freezing the plot system.
	Fixed admin add command (you couldnt add if you werent a mayor/assistant of any town).

      Blocks will slowly change back to whatever blocks we're present at the moment the town block was claimed.
      You can configure certain block types you don't want restored to prevent players exploiting regen for diamond ores.
      Block types to not restore are configured in block_ignore in the worlds txt file data/worlds/worldname.txt
